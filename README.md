# KnightCodeCompiler_SPH

Hello! This is the compiler I built for my CS322 final project! It uses the toy language Knight Code and implements some very basic features. <br />

Some of those features include:  <br />

Print of Strings and Integers  <br />
Basic Mathmatically calulations involving Integers  <br />
Getting input from the user  <br />
If/Else Blocks  <br />
While Loop Implementation  <br />

More features to come!
